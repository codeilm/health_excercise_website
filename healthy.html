            <p> 
            Grapefruit is one of the healthiest citrus fruits.

Besides being a good source of vitamins and minerals, it is known for its ability to aid weight loss and reduce insulin resistance.

For example, in a study in 91 people, those who ate half a fresh grapefruit before meals lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) more weight than those who didn’t (1).

In the same study, the grapefruit group had a significant reduction in insulin levels and reduced insulin resistance (1).

Also, eating grapefruit has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and help prevent kidney stones (2, 3, 4).


<b>Grapefruit is highly nutritious. Eating it may reduce insulin resistance, cholesterol and help prevent kidney stones. Grapefruit may also be useful for weight loss.</b>

Some of watermelon’s antioxidants have been studied for their anti-cancer effects.

Lycopene intake is linked with a reduced risk of cancers of the digestive system, while cucurbitacin E may inhibit tumor growth (52, 53).

Consuming lycopene-rich foods can also promote heart health because of their ability to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure (52).

Of all the fruits, watermelon is one of the most hydrating. It is made up of 92% water, which can help you feel more full (52).<br>
